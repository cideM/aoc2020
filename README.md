# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code 2020 :santa:

## Intro

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2020 in whatever languages I feel like. Every solution is a single file which you can just run like this `./d2/d2.hs` or `./d2/d2.lua`. The code always starts with a shebang line that runs the code in a Nix shell. That means you don't need to install anything, it's all temporary and self-contained.

There are also a few other tools installed for you in the base Nix shell, such as `ormolu` for formatting Haskell and `hlint` for linting, and so on.

## Preparation

Start `cat` and wait for input

```shell
$ mkdir d2
$ cat > d2/input.txt
```

Reload and run

```shell
$ echo "d2/d2.hs" | entr -sc "cat d2/input.txt | ./d2/d2.hs"
```
